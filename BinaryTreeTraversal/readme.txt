This is an implementation of binary tree and important traversal methods.

inTraverse(): method to perform In-Order Trvaersal
preTraverse(): method to perform Pre-Order Traversal
postTraversal(): method to perform Post-Order Traversal

The Tree structure example is: 
									a
								  /   \
								 b     e
							   /  \
							  c    d
							      /  \
								 f    g
